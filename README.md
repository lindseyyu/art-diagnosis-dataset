This project explores the intersection of art and mental health by analyzing visual patterns in artworks created by individuals with schizophrenia.

Applied computer vision techniques (e.g. OpenCV, edge detection, color histograms) to extract quantitative features from scanned images.

Trained classification models to identify stylistic markers associated with clinical diagnoses.

Conducted exploratory feature importance analysis to understand correlations between visual features and mental health conditions.

Project demonstrates interdisciplinary research, modeling, and image data preprocessing in a sensitive and socially impactful context
